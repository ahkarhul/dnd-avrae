### IMPORTANT ^^^ Make sure this server snippet abover gets on the server. Otherwise party members wont be able to use bardic inspiration dice


###Establish Bard Inspiration Self Counter

!test <drac2>
if character().cc_exists("Bardic Inspiration"):
  character().delete_cc("Bardic Inspiration")
if (level < 5 ):
  character().create_cc("Bardic Inspiration",0,charismaMod,"long","bubble")
else:
  character().create_cc("Bardic Inspiration",0,charismaMod,"short","bubble")
</drac2>


###Establish Goblin Fury of the Small Counter

!test <drac2>
if not character().cc_exists("Fury of the Small"):
  character().create_cc("Fury of the Small",0,1,"short","bubble")
</drac2>

###Establish Hit dice
!test <drac2>
if character().cc_exists("Hit Dice (d8)"):
  character().delete_cc("Hit Dice (d8)")
character().create_cc("Hit Dice (d8)",0,BardLevel,"long","bubble")
</drac2>


###Use fury of the small -- COMBAT ONLY
###Usage: !i a "Light Crossbow" -t "Monster" fury

!serversnippet fury {{f'-d {level} -f "Fury of the Small:"|"When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature.

That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level."

###Enthralling performance -- no targeting since this one will be used outside combat.
###Usage: !enthrall

!alias enthrall embed
<drac2>

  args=argparse(&ARGS&)
  character().set_cc("Bardic Inspiration", character().get_cc("Bardic Inspiration") - 1)

If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, avoiding violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest."
