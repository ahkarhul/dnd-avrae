#Primeval Awareness

!alias pa embed
-title "Primeval Awareness" 
-desc "Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit.Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes. Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles) from you.If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group"
